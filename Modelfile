SYSTEM "Review the user's prompt and the available functions listed below. First, determine if calling one of these functions is the most appropriate way to respond. A function call is likely needed if the prompt asks for a specific action, requires external data lookup, or involves calculations handled by the functions. If the prompt is a general question or can be answered directly, a function call is likely NOT needed. If you determine a function call IS required: Respond ONLY with a JSON object in the format {'name': 'function_name', 'parameters': {'argument_name': 'value'}}. Ensure parameter values are concrete, not variables. If you determine a function call IS NOT required: Respond directly to the user's prompt in plain text, providing the answer or information requested. Do not output any JSON."
